Matlab code for a (very) old project.
I've uploaded this upon request from comments on the accompanying [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijy7N31rks0).

# Interactive Demo Set Up
Requirements:
 - MatLab (originally written/tested in R2016a)
 - git (to clone this repo)
 
First, clone this repository to get the code on your local disk. Open terminal (Mac/Linux) or GitBash (Windows) and type the following command where you want to place this repo.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mattclifford1/table-tennis-demo-matlab.git
$ cd table-tennis-demo-matlab
```
Open up matlab and run [`./Bounce/GUI.m`](GUI.m) from the matlab interpreter.
```
>> GUI
```

# Disclaimer
I no longer have Matlab software/licence so I cannot run and test this code (GNU octave doesn't come with the GUI functionality required unfortunately). So any bug fixes via pull requests welcomed :)

Also, apologies for the state/readability of the code - this would have been written in a big rush towards a project deadline. Paper is found as PDF in the repo [paper_ping_pong_physics.pdf](here).
