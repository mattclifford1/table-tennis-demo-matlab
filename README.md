# table-tennis-demo-matlab

Matlab code for a (very) old project.
I've uploaded this upon request from comments on the accompanying [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijy7N31rks0).

# To Run interactive demo
Change in to the Bounce directory and run [`./Bounce/GUI.m`](GUI.m). 

# Disclaimer
I no longer have Matlab software/lisence so I cannot run and test this code! Any bug fixes via pull requests welcomed :)

Also, appologies for the state of the code - this would have been written in a big rush towards a project deadline. Let me know if you would like the accompanying paper with results and maths and I'll try and dig that out.

Happy Coding!
